# Revised-reproduction-package-for-Breza-et-al.-2018

These materials correspond to "The Morale Effects of Pay Inequality" by Emily Breza, Supreet Kaur, and Yogita Shamdasani, which was published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 2018.

So far, with guidance from https://www.socialsciencereproduction.org/ I have modified the original main do file to run in one click and organized the folders according to the conventions found at https://www.projecttier.org/tier-protocol/specifications-3-0/#overview-of-the-documentation. Future work should obtain the raw data and create an Original Data folder to store it in.
